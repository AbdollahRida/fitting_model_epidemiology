# Estimating models in epidemiology with optimization

This repo describes a method to find parameters for a SIR like model.

The problem and the method is described in the [Synthetic_data](https://github.com/mlelarge/fitting_model_epidemiology/blob/master/Synthetic_data.ipynb) notebook and its application to real data is done in the [Real data](https://github.com/mlelarge/fitting_model_epidemiology/blob/master/Real_data.ipynb)
